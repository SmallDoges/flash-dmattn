"""
Verification script for dynamic mask attention fix.

This is a simple test to verify that our fix for the dynamic mask attention
integration resolves the issues between the Python and CUDA implementations.

Key areas that were fixed:
1. Scale attention scores before adding mask values (matching Python implementation)
2. Set non-masked positions to -INFINITY to exclude them from softmax
3. Avoid double-scaling in the softmax calculation

The test verifies these fixes on a small example with controlled values.

    """
    Test the fixed dynamic mask attention implementation.
    
    Before the fix, the CUDA implementation was incorrectly:
    1. Adding mask values without properly scaling the attention scores
    2. Not handling non-masked positions correctly
    3. Potentially double-scaling in the softmax calculation
    
    This test verifies that the fix works as expected when CUDA becomes available.
